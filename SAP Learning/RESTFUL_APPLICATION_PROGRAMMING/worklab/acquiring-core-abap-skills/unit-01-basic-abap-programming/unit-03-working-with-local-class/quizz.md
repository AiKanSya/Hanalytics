# ðŸŒ¸ UNIT 3 - QUIZZ

## ðŸ’® You have defined a class containing instance attributes and static attributes. You have also declared a reference variable but not yet created an instance of the class. Which components of the class can you access at this point, and how?

_Choose the correct answer._

- [ ] Instance components using the reference variable.

- [ ] Instance components using the name of the class.

- [ ] Static components using the reference variable.

- [ ] Static components using the name of the class.

<details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>

- [ ] Instance components using the reference variable.

- [ ] Instance components using the name of the class.

- [ ] Static components using the reference variable.

- [x] Static components using the name of the class.

- [ ] Importing parameters

- [ ] Exporting parameters

- [ ] Changing parameters

- [ ] Exceptions

## ðŸ’® The static constructor is executed when the class is addressed for the first time. When might this be?

_There are two correct answers._

- [ ] At the beginning of the program.

- [ ] When you call a static method of the class.

- [ ] When you instantiate the class.

## ðŸ’® Your class contains a public instance attribute attr. How could you ensure that its value can only be changed within the class?

_There are two correct answers._

- [ ] Make it a private attribute.

- [ ] Convert it into a constant.

- [ ] Leave it in the public section but use the READ-ONLY addition.

- [ ] Move it to a different local class.

## ðŸ’® A class my_class contains the public static method my_method. What is the correct code to call this method?

_Choose the correct answer._

- [ ] my_class->my_method().

- [ ] my_class=>my_method().

- [ ] my_class->my_method( ).

- [ ] my_class=>my_method( ).

## ðŸ’® You have declared two reference variables, ref1 and ref2. ref1 points to an object. You now execute the statement ref2 = ref1. What happens?

_Choose the correct answer._

- [ ] The ABAP system creates a copy of the object to which ref1 is pointing and assigns its address to ref2. There are now two objects.

- [x] The ABAP system assigns the address of the object to which ref1is pointing to reference variable ref2. There is only one object.
